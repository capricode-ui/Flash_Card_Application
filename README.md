# Flash Card Application

This project is a Flash Card application built using Python and the Tkinter library. It allows users to create and study flashcards on their computer. The application provides an interactive interface for creating flashcards with questions and answers, as well as a study mode to test your knowledge.

## Features

1. Flashcard Creation: Users can create flashcards by entering a question and its corresponding answer. The flashcards can be saved for future reference.

2. Study Mode: The application offers a study mode where users can view the flashcards one by one and test their knowledge. Users can reveal the answer by clicking a button and move to the next flashcard.

3. Shuffle and Repeat: Users have the option to shuffle the flashcards for a randomized study session. They can also choose to repeat the flashcards continuously until they decide to stop.

4. Progress Tracking: The application keeps track of the user's progress by indicating the number of flashcards studied and the accuracy rate.
